                    <p>Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The unexpected is our normal routine. This should be interesting. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. and attack the Romulans. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? I'll be sure to note that in my log. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. How long can two people talk about nothing? Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. I'll be sure to note that in my log. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Ensign Babyface! The unexpected is our normal routine. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Not if I weaken first. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Travel time to the nearest starbase?</p>
